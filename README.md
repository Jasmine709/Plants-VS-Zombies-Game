# Plants vs. Zombies — Web Remake

Project Duration: Dec 2023 – Jan 2024

A browser-based remake of the classic *Plants vs. Zombies* game, implemented using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
The game reproduces core mechanics such as planting defensive units, generating sun, firing bullets, and fending off waves of zombies.

This project demonstrates frontend game development techniques including sprite management, animation loops, collision detection, state updates, and DOM-based rendering.

##  Live Demo
Simply open **index.html** in any modern browser to play.

##  Game Features

Players can choose from a set of plants, including:
- **Peashooter**
